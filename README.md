# WEB-PROG.-ASSIGNEMENT-NO.1
An assignment I made for my WEB PROGRAMMING class. Submitted to Prof. Hamza Afzal

Summary:
This project is a minimal backend-only to‑do list built with Node.js and Express, designed to demonstrate the basics 
of setting up an API without the complexity of a database or front‑end. When you start the server (using `node index.js`
or `npm run dev` with nodemon), it listens on port 3000 by default and provides a simple confirmation message at the root
URL so you know it’s running. Behind the scenes, tasks are stored in a plain JavaScript array in memory, and each task 
gets a unique numeric ID generated by a counter. The API offers three endpoints: a POST to `/addTask` where you send a 
JSON body containing a non‑empty “taskName” string, which the server validates before creating and returning a new task 
object with status code 201; a GET to `/tasks` that returns the full list of tasks as JSON so you can see everything you’ve 
added; and a DELETE to `/task/:id` which reads the ID from the URL, finds and removes the matching task from the array, and
returns a confirmation object including the deleted item or a 404 error if no such task exists. Because the data lives only
in memory, restarting the server clears all tasks, making this ideal for learning and quick testing with a tool like Postman.
You don’t need to install or configure any database—everything happens in a few dozen lines of JavaScript. Although simple,
this setup covers essential backend concepts: defining routes, parsing JSON request bodies, handling errors and status codes
, and managing in‑memory data structures. From here you could easily extend the app with features like updating tasks,
adding timestamps, persisting data to a file or a real database, or layering in authentication. As a learning exercise, it
gives you hands‑on experience with Express middleware, routing, and the request/response cycle, forming a solid foundation for
more complex Node.js backends.
